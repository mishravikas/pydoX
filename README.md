# pydoX

This is a python binding for  xdotool. I was working on a project where I had to use xdotool and I was surprised to see that there were no python wrappers for it. I had to write everything from scratch, so I thought of sharing it with others so you don't have to.
####what is xdotool?
It lets you simulate keyboard input and mouse activity, move and resize windows, etc. It does this using X11's XTEST extension and other Xlib functions.
Additionally, you can search for windows and move, resize, hide, and modify window properties like the title. If your window manager supports it, you can use xdotool to switch desktops, move windows between desktops, and change the number of desktops.
